# Cancer-Survival-Project
This project analyzes the *Haberman Breast Cancer Survival Dataset*, which includes data on age, year of surgery, and the number of positive axillary lymph nodes. The goal is to study the relationship between these features and patient survival (5 years or more) using data visualization and machine learning techniques.
